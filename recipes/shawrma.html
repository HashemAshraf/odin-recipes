<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>
<ol>
    <li>500g boneless chicken thighs, thinly sliced</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
    <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon ground coriander</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon ground paprika</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional)</li>
    <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
    <li>Pita bread or flatbreads for serving</li>
    <li>Toppings: sliced tomatoes, cucumbers, onions, and tahini sauce</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Steps:</strong></p>
<ol>
    <li>In a large bowl, combine the olive oil, minced garlic, ground cumin, ground coriander, ground paprika, ground turmeric, cayenne pepper (if using), salt, and pepper. Add the thinly sliced chicken thighs to the bowl and toss until the chicken is well coated with the marinade. Let it marinate for at least 30 minutes, or preferably overnight in the refrigerator for maximum flavor.</li>
    <li>Heat a large skillet or grill pan over medium-high heat. Add the marinated chicken to the pan in a single layer, cooking in batches if necessary. Cook the chicken for about 5-7 minutes on each side, or until it is cooked through and has a nice char. Remove the chicken from the pan and let it rest for a few minutes before slicing it into thin strips.</li>
    <li>Warm the pita bread or flatbreads in a dry skillet or in the oven. To assemble the shawarma, place a generous amount of the sliced chicken onto each piece of bread. Add your desired toppings such as sliced tomatoes, cucumbers, onions, and drizzle with tahini sauce. Roll up the bread to enclose the filling and serve immediately. Enjoy your delicious homemade Shawrma!</li>
