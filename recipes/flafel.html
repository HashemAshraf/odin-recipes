<ol>
    <li>1 cup dried chickpeas</li>
    <li>1 small onion, chopped</li>
    <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
    <li>1/4 cup fresh parsley, chopped</li>
    <li>1/4 cup fresh cilantro, chopped</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon ground coriander</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional)</li>
    <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
    <li>Vegetable oil for frying</li>
</ol>
<P><strong>Steps:</strong></P>
<ul>
    <li>Soak the dried chickpeas in water overnight. Drain and rinse them before use.</li>
    <li>In a food processor, combine the soaked chickpeas, chopped onion, minced garlic, parsley, cilantro, cumin, coriander, cayenne pepper (if using), salt, and pepper. Process until you get a coarse mixture. Be careful not to over-process; you want it to have some texture.</li>
    <li>Form the mixture into small balls or patties, about the size of a golf ball.</li>
    <li>Heat vegetable oil in a deep pan or fryer to 350°F (175°C). Fry the falafel balls in batches until they are golden brown and crispy on the outside, about 3-4 minutes per batch. Remove them with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels.</li>
    <li>Serve the falafel hot with pita bread, tahini sauce, and your favorite toppings such as lettuce, tomatoes, and cucumbers. Enjoy your delicious falafel!</li>
